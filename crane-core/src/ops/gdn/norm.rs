//! RMSNorm with a gated output: `y = (x / rms(x)) * weight * act(gate)`.
//!
//! This is the output-side normalization used by every Gated Delta Net layer —
//! the `z` projection gate modulates the normalized recurrence output before it
//! goes through `out_proj`. Qwen 3.5 gates with silu, Qwen4-Exp with sigmoid
//! (see [`GateActivation`]).
//!
//! Normalization goes through candle's fused `rms_norm`, which accumulates in
//! f32 internally whatever the tensor dtype — so the f32 normalization the
//! manual chain spelled out is preserved, in one launch instead of five. The
//! fused op does require `x` and `weight` to share a dtype; casting `weight`
//! to `x`'s is a no-op clone here, since GGUF dequantizes to the model dtype.
